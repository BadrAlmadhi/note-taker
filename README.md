# Express.js-Note-Taker

## Description 

In this project, I did all the backend by using the node.js and express.js libraries to make different routes for the app to function. I have created htmlRoutes that contain the frontend of the application and connect to express.js to make the frontend display by running the server. 

- What was my motivation? 

This challenge motivated me to learn about express and build routes for the backend to be connecting with the frontend. 

- What I build in this project?

I have built the backend of this challenge. I have created the get, post, and delete routes. I got the get and post to work and I have some challenges making the delete route work. However, I will get back to it to get it fixed

- What Problem dose it solve?

This challenge has created a server to save data into the db.json. When I run the app and add notes we will see that the notes are saved in a JSON file. Also, it helps to make the backend of the web page.

- What did I learned?

I have learned about the backend that should include a db.json file that stores data in it. I have created HTML routes for the front end to be displayed when I run the server. Also, I have created an API routes to save file as JSON. I have learned how to use the GET, POST, and DELETE to make the wen page. I have also learned body parsing to create a unique id for each note created to make the DELETE route to work by selecting the is number.
